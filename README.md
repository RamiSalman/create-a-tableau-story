# create-a-tableau-story
This project aims to create interactive visualizations using tableau software.
- The selected data is ProsperLoan data set, it contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan. In project 6 - EDA I used this data set for exploratory data step and I cleaned it, so the result of that is about 84,000 observation with 40 feature. To see the eda step see the following link :https://github.com/RamiSalman/exploratory-data-analysis-EDA- 
  
- The key feature that found in the previous step is the default loan status that connected with prosper rating, borrower rate and prosper score strongly. So my task now is to create explanatory visualizations of this data with interactive animated visuals.
- summary.pdf file contains summary of the process and the tableau story link.
- CleanData.csv contains the cleaned data (output of EDA project) to use in tableau story.
